Your peripheral nervous system (PNS) is one of two main parts of your bodyâ€™s nervous system.
Your PNS feeds information into your brain from most of your senses. It carries signals that allow you to move your muscles.
Your PNS also delivers signals that your brain uses to control vital, unconscious processes like your heartbeat and breathing.
